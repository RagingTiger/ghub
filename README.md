## About
As you have suspected (simply judging by the name), **ghub** is a simple
command: it uses your `.git` repo to find the
`github.com/user_name/repo_name` URL and open it in a browser.

## Install
First download the repo, and execute the `configure` script:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/RagingTiger/ghub
```

Now `cd` into the repo and execute `configure`:

```
cd ghub
./configure
```

Now **ghub** is ready to use!
